          <h4>High-quality teaching Ranked #3 in the world</h4>
          <p>
            Germany made a meteoric rise this year to take the top place on our
            rankings! And no wonder. Between its incredible reputation as a
            higher education powerhouse and the low cost of tuition and living,
            Germany stands out among the countries of the world as a destination
            for international students. Couple that with the country’s high
            standards of living, cultural opportunities, and safe, efficient
            infrastructure, and you have the ideal study location. Use your time
            in Germany to take in the cultural heritage and diverse natural
            beauty of the countryside.

        <div>
          <h4>Ranked #1 in North America</h4>
          <p>
            The US has been rising steadily in our rankings since 2019 and now
            takes the second-place spot for study-abroad locations! Long a
            popular destination for international students, the US boasts some
            of the world’s highest-ranked universities, numerous research
            opportunities, and a higher education culture that is the stuff of
            Hollywood dreams. Idyllic college campuses awash in autumnal colors,
            roaring crowds cheering their school’s team at brightly lit football
            games, and big-city campuses where co-eds can explore the great
            American metropolises while they study, are actual realities, along
            with every other kind of school and institution imaginable.

          <h4>Ranked #2 in Europe</h4>
          <p>
            The UK is never far from the top of our list, and for good reason.
            As home to some of the most renowned and prestigious universities in
            the world, the United Kingdom is a go-to choice for international
            students. Living and studying in the UK gives international students
            the opportunity to learn and explore in a country steeped in culture
            and history. The UK may occupy a small area compared to some of the
            other countries on this list, but it packs a lot into that space.
            The four countries that make up the United Kingdom boast prehistoric
            monuments, medieval ruins, modern architectural marvels, bustling
            cities, quaint villages, and a vibrant arts and culture scene, with
            each country adding its own unique personality and history to the
            mix.

        <div>
          <h4>Ranked #1 in Oceania</h4>
          <p>
            Australia is a consistent favorite of international students the
            world over. With a wide range of higher education offerings, highly
            ranked universities, and a system that is known for welcoming
            international students, it is no wonder that Australia has been in
            our Top 10 since the beginning. Australia is known for its laid-back
            attitude, amazing climate, and incredible natural beauty. With most
            of its big cities, and therefore, its universities, located along
            the coastal regions, you are never far from the beach.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Ranked #3 in Europe</h4>
          <p>
            For many people, the glamour and charm of Paris sums up the appeal
            of France, and while Paris is certainly the country’s crown jewel,
            studying in France is so much more than just a stroll down the
            Seine. With more than 3,500 public and private higher education
            institutions – from universities and Grandes Ecoles to specialized
            schools for everything from art to medicine – your opportunities for
            excellent higher education are nearly limitless in France.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Achieving Career Goals Ranked #3 in the world</h4>
          <p>
            There’s a reason nearly 900,000 international students chose Canada
            as their study destination in 2023. This North American country is
            diverse, welcoming, and offers flexible, high-quality higher
            education that is recognized throughout the world. For medical and
            STEM students, Canada offers extensive research opportunities, and
            international students in all fields will find generous funding
            options and work schemes. Canada is also a great option for language
            students. With French and English as official languages, studying in
            Canada is an excellent way to learn a new language.
